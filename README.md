# CROP YIELD PREDICTION

I have successfully conducted crop yield prediction utilizing an advanced approach employing four distinct machine learning models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Through rigorous experimentation and fine-tuning, I achieved commendable accuracy levels for each model, showcasing the effectiveness of this predictive modeling endeavor.

The accuracy results are as follows:

* Linear Regression: 90.56%
* Support Vector Regressor (SVR): 91.14%
* Decision Tree Regressor: 83.70%
* Random Forest Regressor: 89.92%

Notably, the Support Vector Regressor outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 91.14%, demonstrating its superior predictive capabilities in this context. The implementation involved meticulous hyperparameter tuning to extract the optimal performance from each model, ensuring that the predictions are as accurate as possible. This comprehensive and methodical approach underscores the reliability and robustness of the crop yield prediction achieved through this machine learning framework.
